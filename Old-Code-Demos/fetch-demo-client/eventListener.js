/*
We can add event listeners directly to an element. Below we find the element and once we have,
we can call "addEventListener". The first parameter is the event this thing will listen for, 
and the second is what to do if that event happens.

This is no different from the equivalent method we use in this demo, both result in
an event listener acting on click events. The syntax is the only difference.

// document.getElementById("submitButton").addEventListener("click", buttonClick());
